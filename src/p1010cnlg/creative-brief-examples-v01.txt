The Verizon exclusive Motorola Moto Z3 is a competitively priced, premium smartphone. Features like the fast charge battery, high end camera and large Super AMOLED display put in on par with the likes of Samsung/Google/iPhone. Even more impressive and relevant to Verizon’s near term network narrative, the Moto Z3 will be the world’s first 5G upgradable smartphone when consumers add the 5G MotoMod attachment.
The 5G MotoMod will launch in December for the 5G PR event and influencer seeding, with full commercial availability in March 2019.


Traditional business objectives include new account growth, base account growth and upgrades.
As part of the planned activity for 5G, the device launch and subsequent Mod availability will serve as “moments in time” to amplify Verizon’s 5G network narrative.


Verizon One Segmentation targets for the Motorola-defined target are Digital Enthusiasts, Productivity Managers.
Moto segmentation: Aspirational, early adopters skewing to the higher end of the market.  Opinion leader - go to person for tech advice for family and friends. Buys from well-known brands. Higher preference for quality & performance compared to design. Pragmatic - less likely to pay more for design nor personalize things to suit their taste and style. Shrewd buyer - does research comparing features and benefits for good value.
5G mobility research is on hold until July.

Our communication task is twofold: convey the value in the Motorola Moto Z3 as an exclusive flagship device at a mid-tier price point, and at the right moment in time clearly explain to consumers that this the first device in market that will be 5G upgradable smartphone.
There should be a clear channel/message assignment, for example the 5G message may only come through in PR and .com where there is more real estate to explain this complex network story.

Although this device has premium features, it is not in the same consideration set as its premium competitors: Samsung/Google/iPhone
While there is a 5G story to tell, tactics, timing and “loudness” will need to be carefully planned so as not to cause confusion in market, and should be coordinated with the 5G campaign efforts.


The device will be priced lower than other premium smartphones
The tech-forward and early adopting target segment will find value in the MotoMod and upgradable 5G features

TradeMore is an eCommerce platform to trade-in pre-owned devices in a safe, secure and reliable way and soon adding capabilities to sell pre-owned devices to consumers.

Increase device acquisition of Pre-Owned devices to further monetize. Maintaining brand independence from Verizon widens market of potential non-Verizon consumers

Smartphone users that don’t trade in at time of purchase/upgrade due to: (1) concerns with losing data on the device, (2) wanting a back up device, and in some cases in lieu of taking insurance, (3) give device to family or friend or (4) believe they can obtain higher value than offered at time of trade in.  Age group 25-34. And for consumers looking to purchase a device, the target segment is cost conscious and piqued by the opportunity to buy a previous gen devices at a significant discount versus $800+ on new device. Age group 18-55.

Motivate consumers to trade in old devices that would otherwise sit in drawers with an urgency due to device value depreciation. Shift consumer perception of used phones as a viable purchase option for budget savvy consumers.

Lack of motivation to sell old devices and knowledge of other resale options beside carrier brick and mortar.

“The best time to sell your device is NOW”

Customers will be rewarded for trading in old device in the form of monetary value, as well as sense of goodwill. Customers will be able to purchase a certified functional device from a credible platform based on their technology needs with the flexibility and affordability of not paying $800+ (either at once or in monthly bills)  - Social Responsibility for recycling
