Long-term Purpose: developing CSAR analogue in Python
  --> project for MWEs, engine for combinatory field model +
  --> for industrial implementations

  --> for construction grammar induction, etc.
  >> answering fundamental questions in linguistics


  >> nature of linguistic research...

        % prepare search string --> in Perl / Python / JavaScript
        >> for each -- SearchString :: form search strings ; then process them one after the other in a normal routine;
        >> keep collecting collocation statistics... >>>

        
        
        
Development notes:


further stage:
    - keyword -> pattern automation
    - pattern extraction automation (using Stanford parser output, etc)
    
    
    principle of the interface:
        - keyword is typed in
        matched patterns are extracted ; presented; selected --> 
        
        
        chosen patterns are used in generation of local contexts
        
        patterns are chained, (top) results of the previous search are used for further search 
            >> co-occurrence filter / ranking needed >> should make sense... ?

    >> understanding the need and the requirements for the combinatory field model...
